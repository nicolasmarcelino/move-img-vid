This is a personal script I use to move videos and pictures to their respective directories.

- First, it tracks specific files
- Move each of them
- Rename them
- Tells how many files are left

I borrowed the string generator from this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2257449).

Warning: the script assumes the directories already exist. If they don't exist, the files are renamed to the destination folder name and they lose their file extensions.
